          First the 2020 Olympics got pushed back to 2021, 
          and now the 2021 State of JavaScript survey is happening now, in 2022!


          It's true: between work, family, and and all the turmoil in the world, 
          some things got disrupted a little.
          

          But while the year may be off-by-one, we hope the data provided by the 
          survey itself will be just as informative and insightful as ever. 
          And don't worry, there will be another survey towards the end of this year to set things straight again!

          Welcome to the survey! This first part is all about figuring out 
          which **features** of the JavaScript language respondents actually know about and use. 


          For each feature, check if you: 


          - Have never heard about it; or are not sure what it is. 
          - Know what it is, but have yet to use it in your code.
          - Have used the feature in your code.

          The next couple sections focus on the **libraries** that make up the JavaScript
          ecosystem. 


          For each library, check if you: 


          - Have never heard about it; or are not sure what it is. 
          - Have heard of it, and would like to learn to use it at some point. 
          - Have heard of it, but are **not** interested in learning more. 
          - Have used it, and would be happy to use it again. 
          - Have used it, but would rather **not** use it again if possible.
